The design and testing of this program was done with consideration to the type of assignment it was.

For future iterations of this project, it would be preferable to include a database as opposed to CSVs to
reduce the amount of issues. 

New pricing codes can currently be added by modifying the CSVs, however, should the project adopt a database,
it would be preferable to include an interface by which users my enter product codes and items, so that users
of any technical expertise might easily add additional products and codes.

I used EclEmma to test coverage of the test case and had full coverage on all pieces of the code 
(minus an IO exception for the buffered reader).
